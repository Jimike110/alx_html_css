# HTML, Basic Project

This directory contains the "HTML, basic" project as part of my ALX Introduction to Software Engineering program.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple and valid HTML file called `base_index.html`. The page should contain:

- A DOCTYPE declaration.
- A head section with a title.
- A body section.

### Task 1: Create a Basic HTML Page

In this task, I created a basic HTML page called `base_index.html`. Ensured that the HTML page is valid.

### Task 2: Enhance the HTML Page

In this task, I copied `base_index.html` to `index.html` and added the following elements to the body:

- At least 4 paragraphs.
- Headings (titles) of levels 1, 2, and 3 using <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> tags.
- A clickable image.
- A link to any online URL.

### Task 3: Create Another HTML Page

In this task, I copied `base_index.html` to `tweets.html` and embedded at least one tweet. Additionally, I added a link to `index.html` for navigation.

### Task 4: Ensure Consistency

To maintain consistency across webpages, I ensured that both `index.html` and `tweets.html` follow this structure:

- The <body> tag must contain exactly three direct sub-tags in that order: <header>, <main>, and <footer>.
- The <header> tag should contain an unordered list of links to each webpage.
- The <footer> tag should contain a paragraph with "Made by <YOUR NAME> - <a href="<ANY LINK>" target="_blank">here</a>".
- The <main> tag should contain two direct sub-tags in that order: <article> and <aside>. The <article> contains existing content, and <aside> contains a placeholder for comments.

### Task 5: Add Creativity

Updated `index.html` to include a table with information about learners.

- Introduced an <article> element after the last </aside> tag.
- The <article> tag should contain a table with a specific structure.


## Project Structure
