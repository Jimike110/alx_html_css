# Smile School Homepage (HTML Only)

This "HTML, advanced" project is part of my ALX Intro to SE curriculum, where I've implemented the HTML structure for a homepage called "Smile School." The focus of this project was to create a semantically structured HTML layout for the webpage, based on the [provided Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage).
