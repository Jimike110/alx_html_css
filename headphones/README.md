# Headphones Website

This project is part of my ALX Intro to SE curriculum, where I've implemented a fully functional web page called "Headphones" using only HTML and CSS, without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The goal of this project is to implement a web page that replicates the [design provided in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company), showcasing my HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design skills.

## Description

In this project, I've translated a designer's vision into a web page using my HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design skills acquired during my ALX training. The goal was to replicate the [provided Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=wFSJVU1p4LCW70MF-0) for the "Headphones" website.

## Features

- Responsive design that ensures optimal user experience on various devices.
- Sections included: Header, Hero Content, "What we do ..." section, "Our results..." section, Contact Us form, and Footer.
- Carefully crafted CSS to match the Figma design without using any external CSS frameworks.
