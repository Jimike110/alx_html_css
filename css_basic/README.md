# CSS, Basic Project

This project was part of the ALX Introduction to Software Engineering program. It focused on basic CSS styling for webpages.

## Project Description

In this project, I enhanced the styling of webpages created in the previous HTML, Basic project by applying CSS rules to improve the appearance and layout of the web content.

### Task 0: Some Early Styling

- Copied the `index.html` and `tweets.html` files from the previous project into this folder.
- Created an empty `styles.css` file.
- Created the `base.css` file and set its content.
- In each of my HTML files, added the following lines within the `<head>` tag to link the CSS files:

```html
<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Task 1: Positioning

- Utilized CSS Flexbox for positioning elements on the page.
- Achieved a layout where the content was structured as follows:

```
Content of the <header> tag
Content of the <article> tag    Content of the <aside> tag
Content of the <footer> tag
```

- Applied the necessary Flexbox properties to achieve this layout.
- Ensured that the content took up the specified proportions of the page width.
- Allowed scrolling within the `<article>` and `<aside>` sections.

### Task 2: Responsive Web Design

- Added the attribute `class="works_on_smartphone"` to the `<body>` tag in the `index.html` file to make the layout responsive.
- Adjusted the viewport settings in the HTML code to ensure proper rendering on smartphones.

### Task 3: Some More Styling

- Customized the appearance of the website.
- Added non-positioning-related CSS rules to `styles.css`, such as colors, backgrounds, and borders.
- Styled the content inside the `<article>` tag as desired.
